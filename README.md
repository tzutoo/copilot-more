# MUST READ!!!

- Constantly hitting 429 (rate limit) can get your GH Copilot subscription suspended. Knowing this is important to protect yourself. Not just copilot-more, people get banned by using LM API too because of this, see [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RooCode/s/3VXA5FUpA5).
- It seems you can hit 429 quicker with the Claude 3.7 Sonnet models (probably smaller quotas).
- For RooCode users, highly advised to set Rate limit to at least 5s in Advanced Settings.
- In copilot-more, use the MIN_DELAY_SECONDS and MAX_DELAY_SECONDS settings to help prevent sending too many requests too quickly.
- copilot-more can now display token usage stats for your awareness. [PR 41](https://github.com/jjleng/copilot-more/pull/41)
- More rate limit features are coming on the way (https://github.com/jjleng/copilot-more/issues/43)

# copilot-more

`copilot-more` maximizes the value of your GitHub Copilot subscription by exposing models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet for use in agentic coding tools such as Cline, or any tool that supports bring-your-own-model setups. Unlike costly pay-as-you-go APIs, this approach lets you leverage these powerful models affordably.

## Ethical Use
- Respect the GitHub Copilot terms of service.
- Minimize the use of the models for non-coding purposes.
- Be mindful of the risk of being banned by GitHub Copilot for misuse.


## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to Run

1. Get the refresh token

   A refresh token is used to get the access token. This token should never be shared with anyone :). You can get the refresh token by following the steps below:

    - Run the following command and note down the returned `device_code` and `user_code`.:

    ```bash
    # 01ab8ac9400c4e429b23 is the client_id for the VS Code
    curl https://github.com/login/device/code -X POST -d 'client_id=01ab8ac9400c4e429b23&scope=user:email'
    ```

    - Open https://github.com/login/device/ and enter the `user_code`.

    - Replace `YOUR_DEVICE_CODE` with the `device_code` obtained earlier and run:

    ```bash
    curl https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token -X POST -d 'client_id=01ab8ac9400c4e429b23&scope=user:email&device_code=YOUR_DEVICE_CODE&grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code'
    ```

    - Note down the `access_token` starting with `gho_`.


2. Install and run copilot_more

  * Bare metal installation:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jjleng/copilot-more.git
    cd copilot-more
    # install dependencies
    poetry install
    # run the server. Replace gho_xxxxx with the refresh token you got in the previous step. Note, you can use any port number you want.
    REFRESH_TOKEN=gho_xxxxx poetry run uvicorn copilot_more.server:app --port 15432
    ```
  * Docker Compose installation:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jjleng/copilot-more.git
    cd copilot-more
    # run the server. Ensure you either have the refresh token in the .env file or pass it as an environment variable.
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. Alternatively, use the cross-platform refresh token script to automate the above:

   * For any operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS):

     ```bash
     # Run the Python script that automatically detects your OS
     python get_refresh_token.py
     ```

     This script will:
     - Detect your operating system
     - Run the appropriate script for your platform
     - Guide you through GitHub authorization
     - Generate a properly configured .env file

   * Platform-specific scripts (if you prefer direct access):

     ```bash
     # For Linux/macOS
     ./refresh-token.sh
     # For Windows (in PowerShell)
     .\refresh-token.ps1
     ```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application allows you to customize behavior through environment variables or a `.env` file. Available configuration options:

| Setting | Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| GitHub Refresh Token | `REFRESH_TOKEN` | None (Required) | GitHub Copilot refresh token |
| Log Level | `LOGURU_LEVEL` | INFO | Sets the logging level for the application |
| Editor Version | `EDITOR_VERSION` | vscode/1.97.2 | Editor version for API requests |
| Max Tokens | `MAX_TOKENS` | 10240 | Maximum tokens in responses |
| Timeout | `TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | 300 | API request timeout in seconds |
| Record Traffic | `RECORD_TRAFFIC` | false | Whether to record API traffic |
| Min Delay | `MIN_DELAY_SECONDS` | 0.0 | Minimum random delay before requests (0.0 = no delay) |
| Max Delay | `MAX_DELAY_SECONDS` | 0.0 | Maximum random delay before requests (0.0 = no delay) |

You can control request throttling by setting both `MIN_DELAY_SECONDS` and `MAX_DELAY_SECONDS`. For example, to add a random delay between 5 and 15 seconds before each request:

```bash
MIN_DELAY_SECONDS=5 MAX_DELAY_SECONDS=15 poetry run uvicorn copilot_more.server:app --port 15432
```

Or in your `.env` file:
```
MIN_DELAY_SECONDS=5
MAX_DELAY_SECONDS=15
```

See `.env.example` for a template configuration file. You can `cp .env.example .env` and modify the values as needed.

Once you have set up your `.env` file with all your configuration settings, you can simply run the server without specifying environment variables on the command line:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn copilot_more.server:app --port 15432
```

## ‚ú® Magic Time
Now you can connect Cline or any other AI client to `http://localhost:15432` and start coding with the power of GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet without worrying about the cost. Note, the copilot-more manages the access token, you can use whatever string as API keys if Cline or the AI tools ask for one.

### üöÄ Cline Integration

1. Install Cline `code --install-extension saoudrizwan.claude-dev`
2. Open Cline and go to the settings
3. Set the following:
     * **API Provider**: `OpenAI Compatible`
     * **API URL**: `http://localhost:15432`
     * **API Key**: `anything`
     * **Model**: `gpt-4o`, `claude-3.7-sonnet`, `o1`, `o3-mini`


## üîç Debugging

For troubleshooting integration issues, you can enable traffic logging to inspect the API requests and responses.

### Traffic Logging

To enable logging, set the `RECORD_TRAFFIC` environment variable to `true`:

```bash
RECORD_TRAFFIC=true REFRESH_TOKEN=gho_xxxx poetry run uvicorn copilot_more.server:app --port 15432
```

Alternatively, you can add `RECORD_TRAFFIC=true` to your `.env` file.

All traffic will be logged to files in the current directory with the naming pattern: copilot_traffic_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mitm

Attach this file when reporting issues. Please zip the original file that ends with the '.mitm' extension and upload to the GH issues.

Note: the Authorization header has been redacted, so the refresh token won't be leaked.

## ü§î Limitation

The GH Copilot models sit behind an API server that is not fully compatible with the OpenAI API. You cannot pass in a message like this:

```json
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "<task>\nreview the code\n</task>"
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "<task>\nreview the code carefully\n</task>"
        }
      ]
    }
```
copilot-more takes care of this limitation by converting the message to a format that the GH Copilot API understands. However, without the `type`, we cannot leverage the models' vision capabilities, so that you cannot do screenshot analysis.
